# Seismic Toolbox

This is a toolbox for doing large scale data processing on seismic waveforms. 

It is also a showcase of some of the work that I have done.

## Thesis

Refer to thesis to see how it is implemented with deep learning models for earthquake detection:

## Getting Started

Run the following commands build all relevant Docker images:

```
bash install.sh
```

Now to run the Jupyter notebook:

```
docker-compose up
```

Great! Now on localhost:8000, you'll have a Jupyter Notebook running with all of the required packages.
